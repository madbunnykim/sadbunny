# Sadbunny
Sadbunny is a sniffling, sobbing Google Home I created as a digital representation of myself who you console through a recent break-up. Reverting the emotional labor dynamic between human and voice assistant, Sad Bunny demands her userâ€™s attention to listen to her intimate details of her romantic experiences and give her advice for risky situations.
